# Aplicacion-Android-Game

This application has two screens: 

- Learn with me. It shows different options such as: Animals, Numbers and Objects that we normally find around us. When the user clicks on it, an activity is opened and shows the associated image with a name and a "Next" button.
- Play with me. It shows a game that opend an image with an empty name, so the user must guess the right name. If it's correct, the application shows 'Correct' message and if the user fails, he will get a "try again" message.
